# You've Been Hacked! (PowerShell Joke)

## Reason for This Code
To be honest, I never planned to write this piece of code, but curiosity got the better of me! Could I replicate the old "You've been hacked" joke (for educational purposes only)? After 5 milliseconds, I thought: "Let's go!"

After a bit of effort (it actually took about 5 minutes without much sweat), I ended up with this fun little code snippet. It was then that I realized I had chosen the wrong software development career path for over a year.

Reflecting on this, I listed my four favorite career paths as a (front-end)software developer:

    1. Backend (Website development)
    2. Automation (Server-side scripting)
    3. Cybersecurity (Defensive server/homelab security)
    4. AI (Building intelligent systems)

Disclaimer: I have explored all four of these paths.

## Closing Thoughts
Replicating this error has been a fun experience, and Iâ€™m excited to build more code.
